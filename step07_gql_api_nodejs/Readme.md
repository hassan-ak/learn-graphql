# Create a GraphQL API using NodeJS

This tutorial is using Apollo Server to create a gql api in nodejs. Apollo Server is an open-source, spec-compliant GraphQL server that's compatible with any GraphQL client, including Apollo Client. It's the best way to build a production-ready, self-documenting GraphQL API that can use data from any source.

Alright, let's break it down! We're starting from scratch, building a GraphQL API using Node.js. At this point, we're keeping it simpleâ€”no database connections yet. The tutorial is designed as a sequence, so each step builds on the last. Don't skip any, just follow along, and we'll unravel the structure of this GraphQL API together.
